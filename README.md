# New Project And Patreon Launch Announcement

Hi there!

I'm Alex, the creator of [Freeter](https://medium.com/hackernoon/how-i-hacked-my-workflow-45e328ad8d9b). Since selling it almost 5 years ago, I've received lots of messages from users asking if there is any way to do something as the new owner never released any updates. For me, not only as the creator of Freeter, but also as the user, it was an important application too and it's sad to see what has become of it. Over time, Freeter has become obsolete, showing more and more "update your browser" notifications and causing more and more issues in various web apps accessed through it. And since there are no alternatives to Freeter, I thought about building a better version of it from scratch, with open source code, if there's enough support.

On **January 19, 2022** at 4 PM GMT a Patreon campaign will be launched to fund the development of the project. Patrons who join within the first 10 days (by **January 29, 2022**) will get a **very special reward** â€” **lifetime** credit as a **Founding Sponsor/Backer** on the project website, in the application, in the community and the repository.

If you are interested in becoming a Founding Patron and want to be notified when the campaign launches, subscribe to [this issue](https://github.com/alexk111/new-project/issues/1) or send an email to `patron (at) alexkaul (dot) com` (I'll reply within 24 hours).

## Quick Story Behind Freeter

In the second half of 2015, as a freelance developer working on multiple projects simultaneously, I came up with the idea of Freeter, and built it by March 2016. For more on what it does and how it works, see:
- ["How I hacked my workflow"](https://medium.com/hackernoon/how-i-hacked-my-workflow-45e328ad8d9b)
- Using Freeter ([Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPxg0HzQNTk) and [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPxg0HzQNTk))

The list of feature requests grew, and a few releases later I was already spending all my time on discussing and implementing new features and fixing issues. By the middle of 2017 I had almost no savings left, felt burnt out and had no choice but to sell the project. At the time of sale, there were 12k+ users, including 400-500 users with the Pro license. In hindsight, a freemium business model with a free license and a one-time purchase of a Pro license was probably not the right fit for the product.

The buyer of Freeter was selected through an auction. A few days later (as far as I remember) another Freeter user contacted me, saying that he also wanted to buy it, and asked for the contacts of the new owner. He then bought the project from the auction winner and never released any updates.

## About New Project

It will be a desktop application (for Win, Mac, Linux) serving the same purpose as the original Freeter - to boost the productivity by collecting everything you need to work in one place, streamlining projects and workflows, and providing easy access.

The whole project will be open source, under [MIT license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).

## Patron Rewards

As a reward for supporting the project, patrons will be able to add their names and company names/logos to Backers and Sponsors sections on the website, in the application and in the repository. They will also get badges showing their support on the community (forum) and on the website when mentioned.

* There will be a separate area for each membership level.
* Names and Logos will be placed on a first-come, first-served basis.
* Displaying your badge, name, company name or logo is opt-in. You control it being public or private.

## Founding Patrons

Since founding patrons will not get immediate benefits from the rewards at the development stage, unlike regular patrons supporting an established project, and since the initial development of the project is entirely dependent on founding patrons, they will get **very special rewards**:
 - **Lifetime credit and recognition** as founding patrons with mentions on the special **Founding Sponsors/Backers** sections and special **Founding Sponsor/Backer** badges.
 - **A free month** of membership for each **consecutive month** of being a patron since the start of the campaign.

To become a founding patron:
  1. Join the campaign by **Jan 29, 2022**.
  2. Be a patron for **4 consecutive months**.
